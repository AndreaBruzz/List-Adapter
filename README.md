# List Adapter - University Project

This repository contains a Java implementation of a List Adapter, developed as part of a second-year university project. The project was implemented in an outdated version of Java that did not yet natively support lists. The adapter provides a uniform interface to interact with lists, offering flexibility in handling data structures.

One of the main focuses of the project was writing comprehensive unit tests to validate the functionality and ensure reliability of the adapter.

## Features
- Implemented in Java.
- Adapts various list types to a uniform interface.
- Provides easy-to-use methods to access and modify list elements.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AndreaBruzz/List-Adapter.git
   ```
2. **Compile and run the project** using your preferred Java IDE or command line.

## Folder Structure
- **myAdapter**: Contains the core implementation of the List Adapter.
